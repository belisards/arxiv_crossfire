While firearm violence affects every country globally, the burden is significantly higher in many low- and middle-income countries. However, despite overwhelming statistics, there is a lack of research, reporting, and prioritization of firearm violence as a global public health issue, and when attention is given it is focused on high-income countries. This paper discusses the impact of firearm violence, the factors which shape such violence, and how it fits into global public health frameworks in order to illustrate how firearm violence is a global health issue which warrants evidence-based advocacy around the world.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Internet and social media data, we have seen a considerable growth in the availability of data related to human right abuses. Human Rights and Non-Government organisations, whose purpose is to provide rehabilitation services and support to victims of torture, require powerful and appropriate methods to learn from and draw insights from this data. Current approaches usually require large amounts of expensive labelled data in order to make accurate predictions. This paper proposes an approach to applying a domain specific term extraction method using an ontology to train a semi-supervised co-training classifier that would classify the data collected into relevant categories. The method implements and utilises a domain ontology specifically created for the domain of human rights as background knowledge to extract the preliminary terms for generating the labelled data in order to train the classifier. Out experiments show that this method improves over the individual classifiers, while also displaying a significant reduction in the amount of labelled data required for training accurate classifiers.},

This paper presents an NLP system that extracts from English language news reports the names of security force units and the biographical details of their personnel, and infers the formal relationship between them. Published alongside this paper are the system's code and training dataset. We find that the experimental NLP system performs the task at a fair to good level. Its performance is sufficient to justify further development into a live workflow that will give insight into whether its performance translates into savings in time and resource that would make it an effective technical intervention.},

We released a novel corpus collected from Twitter and manually labeled with 4 categories of violent incidents (plus the no-incident label). The shared task focused on the Mexican variant of Spanish and it was divided into two tracks: (1) a binary classification task in which users had to determine whether tweets were associated to a violent incident or not; and (2) a multi-label classification task in which the category of the violent incident should be spotted. More than 40 teams registered for the task and 12 participants submitted predictions for the final phase. Very competitive results were reported in both sub tasks, where transformer-based solutions obtained the best results.

	abstract = {Social media is not just meant for entertainment, it provides platforms for sharing information, news, facts and events. In the digital age, activists and numerous users are seen to be vocal regarding human rights and their violations in social media. However, their voices do not often reach to the targeted audience and concerned human rights organization. In this work, we aimed at detecting factual posts in social media about violation of human rights in any part of the world. The end product of this research can be seen as an useful asset for different peacekeeping organizations who could exploit it to monitor real-time circumstances about any incident in relation to violation of human rights. We chose one of the popular micro-blogging websites, Twitter, for our investigation. We used supervised learning algorithms in order to build human rights violation identification (HRVI) models which are able to identify Tweets in relation to incidents of human right violation. For this, we had to manually create a data set, which is one of the contributions of this research. We found that our classification models that were trained on this gold-standard dataset performed excellently in classifying factual Tweets about human rights violation, achieving an accuracy of upto 93\% on hold-out test set.},

We examine time series trends for different types of conflict and evaluate discernible changes taking place as global awareness of COVID-19 spread.

We specifically examine violent conflict events (e.g., battles, remote violence and bombings, and violence against civilians) as well as civil demonstrations (e.g., protests and riots) using data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project. Globally we see a relatively short-term decline in conflict, mostly driven by a sharp decrease in protest events, that has since recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Critical heterogeneity at the country level, however, persists. Finally, context-specific details challenge robust causal inference identifying the specific relationship between policy responses and conflict.},
